In this project, I developed responsive web designs using Bootstrap, ensuring compatibility across different devices. 
I effectively utilized Bootstrap components to design web pages and create user-friendly interfaces. Additionally, 
I further enhanced my web design by incorporating form elements, facilitating user input, and providing an interactive experience. 
Leveraging Bootstrap's provided structures for code layout and organization, I maintained project files in an orderly and manageable manner.
